Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering | PRODIGY_ML_02  This project is part of my Machine Learning internship, where I applied K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. The objective was to explore unsupervised learning techniques to identify natural groupings in customer data.
